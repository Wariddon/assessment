# post test assessment

---
### V1.01 - 21/02/2024


---
### project structure
- project directory ( ./posttest )
- postman (file name posttest_java.postman_collection ) 
- run with docker-compose.yml to start app & database (or you can edit for local if you want!) 
- after start app you can run my swagger with url http://localhost:8888/swagger-ui/index.html

### anything else about starting application

1. before start docker-compose make sure my app can't be start with local
2. try to run "./gradlew clean build wrapper bootJar" in local to make sure app can be start  
3. run docker-compose up and enjoy my code !! 
4. don't forget to use "./gradlew test"
